      <p class = "bio-info">Hi there! My name is Aru Singh, my pronouns are she/her, and I am a Junior undergraduate student at Northwestern University expected to graduate in June 2024. I am studying Computer Science in the McCormick School of Engineering and Neuroscience in the Weinberg School of Arts and Sciences. I seek interdisciplinary opportunities that allow me to tap into both of my majors. What I love most is being able to apply machine learning to different fields, which is what I do in my research. As a result, what I am seeking in a career is something that allows me to use both my computer science background, espcially with machine learning or AI, and my natural sciences background together.</p>

      <p class = "bio-info">I am originally from Maple Grove, Minnesota, so I have been in the US Midwest for almost all of my life. Outside of school, research, and extracurriculars, I enjoy playing basketball with the Northwestern Women's Club Basketball team, reading books, and finding good restuarants to eat at in Chicago.</p>
